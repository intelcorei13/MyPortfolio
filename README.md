# 🌐 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio, a responsive website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my academic journey, technical skills, and data-driven projects.

This site highlights my works in business analytics, web development, and predictive modeling, including hands-on projects from university coursework and independent exploration. Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow learner, I invite you to explore and connect.
